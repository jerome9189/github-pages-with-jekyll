Today was our last day in Chicago, and I wanted to check off a couple of touristy things. We had Chicago-style hot dogs and a cake shake at Portillo's. They hot dogs were tiny, soggy, and frankly, overrated. ðŸ‘Ž

A trip to Chicago would be incomplete without a picture in front of the Cloud Gate (aka the Bean), so here we are.

Later, we had some Indian food and a drink at a fantastic Tiki bar, before getting on the train to Boston.
