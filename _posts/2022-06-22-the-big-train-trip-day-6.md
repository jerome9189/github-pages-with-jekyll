Today's been packed. We started off the day with a trip to the Milwaukee Art Museum. I'm a fan of the architecture.

I'm no art connoisseur but this museum is definitely among my top 5 art museums. They had a ton of collections, from old French advertising posters to old sculptures to optical illusions.

Then we went to the gorgeous Mitchell Park Domes. They have 3 beautiful glasshouses, each with plants from a different biome. We saw tons of flowers and fruits on the plants too. It's hard to overstate how worthy it is of a stop in Milwaukee.

We had lunch at AJ Bombers, this casual American joint -- their shtick is launching "bombs" loaded with peanuts in shells towards customers' tables. That was fun to watch. Oh, and the food was good too.

This is random, but it was hard not to think about sriracha as I walked around Milwaukee. All the fire hydrants looked like this.

Later, we had drinks at Bryant's Cocktail Lounge, a quiet, tucked away place with no menu (you just describe what you want to the bartender), vintage vibes, and those old cash registers that go *cha-ching*. Another great hidden gem. They also specialize in boozy ice cream shakes. As you can see, it was too dark for me to include any decent pictures of the drinks (they tasted great, though).
