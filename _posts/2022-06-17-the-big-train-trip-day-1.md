Jenna and I have been planning this trip ever since we learned about Amtrak's USA Rail Pass, which lets you ride 10 segments (an embark and a disembark counts as a segment). We're journeying in a loop and making these 10 stops:
- East Glacier Park MT
- Milwaukee WI
- Madison WI
- Chicago IL
- Boston MA
- New York City NY
- Washington DC
- New Orleans LA
- Los Angeles CA
- Portland OR
- Seattle WA (home!)

This map visualizes our route nicely; the travel segments are in blue and the stops are in yellow.
