Jenna and I have been planning this trip ever since we learned about Amtrak's USA Rail Pass, which lets you ride 10 segments (an embark and a disembark counts as a segment). We're journeying in a loop and making these 10 stops:
- East Glacier Park MT
- Milwaukee WI
- Madison WI
- Chicago IL
- Boston MA
- New York City NY
- Washington DC
- New Orleans LA
- Los Angeles CA
- Portland OR
- Seattle WA (home!)

This map visualizes our route nicely; the travel segments are in blue and the stops are in yellow.

Our journey begins at King Street Station, which I think has a very grand look to it.

We boarded the Empire Builder train, which had a ton of leg room, even for coach class. I would call the train convenient to work on, except for the fact that Wi-Fi is virtually non-existent, and you have to rely on your personal hotspot which typically has a spotty connection in most places along the route.

It's a welcome change to taking a flight. You get wide seats, lots of luggage allowance, large windows and mostly decent views.

But some things don't change when you have to travel with other people. Now, excuse me while I try to get a few hours of sleep as this child screams his head off...
