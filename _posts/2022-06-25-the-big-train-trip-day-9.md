We took a bus to Chicago this morning. 3ish hours. 

The public transit here seems decent. We checked into the hotel and then headed out to explore Lincoln Park Zoo. We saw a ton of really cool birds :)

We had dinner at "2d Restaurant", an Instagram-worthy monochrome restaurant. They had some great fried chicken sandwiches, but the mochi donuts were sub-par. I'd rather stick with [dochi](https://www.dochicompany.com/). They had a bathtub thing to take pictures in so you know I had to do it.

After that, we visited the Chicago Magic Lounge, where we saw the Signature Show. Chicago has a pretty rich history of magic, especially close-up magic, and the Lounge seems to be reintroducing it to the city. The show was super fun, with many exceptional perfomances, including some live music and comedy. They had some crazy good cocktails as well -- some of the best I've ever had.
