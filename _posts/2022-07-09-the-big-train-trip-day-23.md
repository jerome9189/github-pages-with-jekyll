We started today with a morning walk through the charming Garden District.

It was so hot that we had to grab some frozen coffee (and the famous beignets!) at Cafe Du Monde.

Next, we explored the New Orleans Botanical Garden (yes, another one). There were quite a few fruit-bearing plants, among many others.

We also saw the New Orleans Train Garden which had lots of little replicas of New Orleans buildings, trains, and streetcars. The trains actually ran on schedules and there were about 1300 feet of track. We even saw a model of the train we rode into the city!

Later, we checked out this really *fancy* cemetery -- apparently, above-ground tombs aren't uncommon in New Orleans, due to a combination of historical and cultural influences, as well as to prevent water-logging / displacement of coffins.

It was also close to Bastille Day, and since New Orleans is strongly influenced by French culture, we did see celebrations, including a blcok party; here's part of it:

In the evening, we explored more of the touristy French Quarter. We had a lot of great drinks, including a perfect [Ramos Gin Fizz](https://www.liquor.com/recipes/ramos-gin-fizz/), and the crispiest, most delicious pork belly I've ever had the pleasure of eating.

After sunset, we walked through Bourbon street, which has some "trashy Las Vegas" vibes. My phone died around this point, so I don't have many pictures, but walking that street at night is like a fever dream. I've seen a lot of crazy stuff tonight.
