We started the longest train segment of our trip today: New Orleans -> Los Angeles. The ETA is ... 45 hours. 45 long hours on a train. I'm dreading this. I read online that at the El Paso train stop, a lady sells burritos by the tracks. The train makes a stop at El Paso tomorrow, and I'm looking forward to obtaining a few burritos.
