Jenna went to work today at her company's Boston office. I spent most of the day doing laundry (we'd gone through most of the clothes we brought on this trip), catching up on writing these posts, some light cooking, and just goofing off. In the evening, we went out for food and drinks. One of my favorite dishes was this saucy fried cauliflower thing at Cask'n Flagon. Delicious.

Later, we did some light bar crawling ;)
