We arrived in New Orleans pretty late at night, but still had time to hit a couple of cocktail bars. My favorite was [Cure](https://www.curenola.com/), where I had a really great sesame and toasted almond Old Fashioned (not pictured). Definitely gonna recreate it later.

The hotel we're staying at looks pretty old, and our Lyft driver tells us that it's probably haunted. Exciting.
