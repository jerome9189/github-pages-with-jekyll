People seem a lot chattier on the train. We hung out in the observation car, where a nice old lady told us her life story. Her career in science. Beating three different cancers. Losing her mother just a few weeks prior. Deep stuff, you know. The observation car is a nice place.

Finally arrived at East Glacier Park MT. Quaint. Lovely views. But the place is so remote that neither Jenna nor I were able to get cellular reception.

Also a quirky little shop dedicated to wooden spoons. They also had the "World's Largest Purple Spoon (maybe)".

Montana is known for huckleberries, so we had to grab a slice of huckleberry pie (yum). Also had some huckleberry jalapeño margaritas at Serrano's, the local Mexican restaraunt. Definitely will be replicating them at home with jalapeño and blueberry syrups.

Tomorrow, a tour guide will drive us to a bunch of scenic spots in Glacier National Park.
