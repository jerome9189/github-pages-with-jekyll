We're in Milwaukee! Our train was delayed a couple of hours, so we did have to skip a few things we had planned. After checking into our hotel, we took a walk to and through Veteran's Park. We didn't do a whole lot of exploring -- the heat was downright oppressive.

We grabbed gyros for dinner at a Greek restaurant on Brady Street and then stopped at a bar where I had what I consider the best dessert I've ever had. It was a chocolate mousse accompanied by hazelnut crumble, chocolate cake, caramel, basil-mint oil and torched meringue. I have to try and recreate this when I get back.

I realize I didn't take too many pictures today; not much caught my eye. Hopefully tomorrow's different.
