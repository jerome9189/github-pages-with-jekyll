I learnt that we were sitting in the last car in the train, meaning that we could see out of the back window. Saw some very relaxing views there.

Although we've visited Portland briefly in the past, it still feels like a brand new experience. I'm a huge fan of these drinking water fountains we saw scattered around downtown Portland (they're called [Benson Bubblers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benson_Bubbler), and they run continuously for days).

In the evening, we visited the International Rose Test Garden where we saw many, many roses. I was surprised at how different roses can look from each other.

After that, we visited the Pittock Mansion viewpoint to take in a fabulous view of the city.

We then had some delicious sushi and sake for dinner, and then got a classic Voodoo Doll from Voodoo Doughnut.

Later, we got the signature Spanish Coffees from Huber's Cafe. Our bartender was very skilled, as you can see.
