We did a lot of the touristy things today. First, the American Museum of Natural History. Our favorite things there were some very high-res prints of bugs, and the crystal exhibit.

Then, we went to the Top of the Rock (Rockefeller Center) to get some of the best views NYC has to offer. I really liked the view of Central Park from here.

We walked briefly through Times Square, which was extremely crowded -- I can see why the locals avoid it. But of course, we're tourists and we have to get our pictures :)

Our next stop was Los Tacos No. 1, and these are by far the best tacos I've ever had. The beef tacos were incredibly flavorful and tender. I know I'm gonna order at least 10 of these when I'm back in NYC.

We then took a nice evening stroll through Central Park, which seems to be a very popular time for park visitors -- there was a ton of activities, music and dancing. It was very lively, and significantly better maintained than the rest of the city.
