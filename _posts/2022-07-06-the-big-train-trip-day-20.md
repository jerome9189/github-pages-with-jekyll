I'd forgotten how fun it is to get around DC using those Lime scooters. After grabbing lunch and some delicious kulfi pops at Spice 6 (Chipotle meets Indian food), we Lime scootered to the United States Botanic Gardens, where we managed to see many cool plants, including tiny pineapples and the rare blooming of a Corpse Flower.

Next, we visited the Capitol Building for a few quick pictures.

Then, we went to the Internation Spy Museum, which had a ton of cool exhibits, including James Bond's DB5.

Finally, we grabbed some dinner and drinks with a couple of friends from Jenna's work.
