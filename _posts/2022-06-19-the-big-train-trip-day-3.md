Woke up early today for the bus tour. We picked up some coffee and a breakfast sandwich at the local grocery store on our way to the pickup spot.

The bus tour was so fun! We weren't able to visit all the originally planned spots due to some road closures, but our guide had some great alternate spots. We made several stops to take short walks and photos.

We also stopped at a lodge for lunch with a great view of the mountains. Also, sheep.

While we weren't able to see the famous mountain goats (due to road closures and such), we did manage to see several bears including a mama bear and her three cubs!

Finally returned from the tour at 5 PM, grabbed dinner at Serrano's, and just walked around the town a bit. Stumbled upon a golf course, and the staff let us try chipping (I've never played golf before). Folks are so friendly here! Tomorrow, we'll be taking the train to our next stop, Milwaukee.
