We're halfway done with the Big Train Trip! Today, we had a thorough exploration of Boston, courtesy of Victor. One of our busiest days by far. Most of our day was spent walking the Freedom Trail, a strip of brick running through the city hitting a lot of the cool things to visit.

The first part of our Boston exploration had an academic flavor -- we explored the campuses of Harvard and MIT. We touched John Harvard's statue's left shoe, which is supposed to bring good luck (also why it's shiny).

We walked for so long and through so many places after that, that I don't even remember any of the names. As I mentioned earlier, the tour was mostly guided by the Freedom Trail. We made plenty of stops for food and drink, including for crab/lobster/shrimp rolls, clam chowder, cannolis, pizza, Boston cream pies...

In the evening, we had some drinks at a rooftop bar, stumbled around the city, and then got home to throw together a late night cheeseboard. Jenna and I will go to NYC tomorrow. See ya later, Victor, and thanks for a great time!
