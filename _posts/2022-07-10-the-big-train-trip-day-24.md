This morning, we got in a van which took us to Slidell, where we got in a boat to tour a swamp! Our tour guide was pretty great, and knew how to lure many of the animals out for us to see. The alligators in the swamp had even been trained to eat marshmallows off a stick!

After the tour, we were dropped back in New Orleans, and we had an incredibly tasty grilled shrimp Po' Boy for lunch.

We spent the rest of the evening visiting a couple of public spots in the city, including Armstrong Park and Jackson Square.

We had a good dinner at Brennan's Restaurant. Brennan's also happens to be the birthplace of the Bananas Foster dessert, so you know we just *had* to get some.
