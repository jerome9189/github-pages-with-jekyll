We reached El Paso and finally managed to purchase the burritos from the legendary burrito lady, Juanita. As you can see, demand was quite high.

The burritos themselves weren't anything special, but I was more than willing to pay $12 for 4 hot potato/meat burritos.

It was interesting to watch the train get quite close to the US-Mexico border wall as we passed through El Paso.
