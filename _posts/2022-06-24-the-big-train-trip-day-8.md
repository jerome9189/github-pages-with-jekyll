We visited Fromagination today, a delightful little shop with a great variety of cheese (and lots of sampling opportunities). We got to try Grand Cru Surchoix, a World Cheese Championship-winner and a lovely snack plate.

We spent the rest of the day eating and urban hiking. We saw the Wisconsin State Capitol and the University of Wisconsin-Madison Arboretum, and walked through a few parks.

For dinner, we had the fantastic 8 course tasting menu (they call it their Culinary Dinner Theater) at DelecTable. The courses were very thoughtfully made, and you can watch the chefs prepare and plate the food live. The drink pairings were on point as well. I wish I came in hungrier!
