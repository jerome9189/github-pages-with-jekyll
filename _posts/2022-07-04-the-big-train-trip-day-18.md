It's the Fourth of July! We took the ferry from Battery Park to Liberty Island this morning to see the Statue, which was really cool but smaller than I expected. I'm happy to have finally crossed this off my bucket list! It's odd how I've been to New York twice before without visiting it.

It was cool to get into the statue's pedestal and see the insides of the thing. The museum on the island was also a quick, fun stop.

The ferry ride also lends itself to some great views.

We stopped by Xi'an Famous Foods for lunch -- the spicy cumin lamb Biang Biang noodles were fantastic, and we also bought some of the famous chili oil.

We then stopped by the 9/11 Memorial walking to Brooklyn over the Brooklyn Bridge.

Once there, we walked to the Brooklyn Heights Promenade, which has one of my favorite views in all of the city.

Later, we had an early dinner at Ignazio's, one of my favorite pizza spots in DUMBO. Their Tex-Mex pizza is fantastic -- I really liked the use of cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella on a pizza.

In the evening, we managed to snag a spot at Transmitter Park to view the fireworks. The crowd was massive, and we were lucky to get a spot. I'm glad that the show was actually worth the wait.
