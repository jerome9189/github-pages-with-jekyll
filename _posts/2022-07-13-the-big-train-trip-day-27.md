Finally reached Los Angeles this morning. Our friend Divij is letting us crash at his place. We spent the early afternoon checking out contemporary art at The Broad in Downtown LA.

We had a late lunch with Divij at Ã‰lephante in Santa Monica. The pizza, drinks, and whipped eggplant were all perfect.
