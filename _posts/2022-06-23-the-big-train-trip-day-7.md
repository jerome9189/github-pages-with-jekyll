We spent most of today just eating and drinking before catching a bus to Madison, WI. Below are some highlights:
- Italian food at Onesto

- An ice cream flight at Purple Door with unique flavors -- I enjoyed the Raspberry Jalape√±o one

- A very elaborately garnished Bloody Mary at Sobelman's. I don't even like Bloody Marys but I had to check it out because it looked so over-the-top.

- Milwaukee Public Market. There's heaps of great vendors; I am a huge fan of Kehr's chocolate-covered cherries.

We arrived late in Madison. It's summer but there's still a lot of college students here (presumably from University of Wisconsin). We'll explore around here more tomorrow.
