There's a "quiet car" on the train from Boston to NYC, so we decided to get on it to try and catch up on some sleep. Of course, there's always some inconsiderate parent who ruins things by bringing their noisy child... At least the views were nice!

Our NYC schedule is super-packed. After checking into the hotel, we headed straight to Chinatown. We had some phenomenal ramen at Ramen Ishida. Next, we had some delicious (and impossibly cheap?) pork dumplings at Shu Jiao Fu Zhou. Feeling very full, we went to Levain Bakery to get a single, thick chocolate chip walnut cookie. Another successful afternoon.

Later that evening, we dressed up to go to Oxalis, a Michelin star restaurant with *carte blanche* dining, meaning we didn't know what we'd be served. We had 9 courses, and it was incredibly expensive, but each course was just *chef's kiss*.
