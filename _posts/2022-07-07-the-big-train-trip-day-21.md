We had just enough time today to visit the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History before our train to New Orleans. We saw some pretty cool exhibits; here are a few highlights:

We grabbed our luggage and got on the train shortly after leaving the museum. Fun fact: coach class passengers don't get to eat nice meals in the dining car, so our food options limited. So we try and bring our own snacks (and the occasional Soylent) as alternatives to the crappy microwaveable meals in the cafe car :)
