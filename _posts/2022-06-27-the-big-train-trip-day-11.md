We had some amazing food at Chinatown for lunch today. The cumin lamb roujiamo (the sandwich-looking thing) at Xian Cuisine was out of this world.

Next, we visited the Museum of Science and Industry. This one was a bit out of the way, but it was totally worth it. Lots of great, interactive exhibits. Also, there was this really cool LEGO art collection.

We liked the food in Chinatown so much that we went right back there for dinner.

Later, we stopped by the Chicago Riverwalk to watch Art on the Mart, a nightly digital art show projected onto a building.
