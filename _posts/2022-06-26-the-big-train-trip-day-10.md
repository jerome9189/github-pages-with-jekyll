We had a very touristy day today. First stop was Garfield Park Conservatory. Lots of cool plants! I must say that I've started to become slightly jaded to conservatories, zoos, botanical gardens and the like. But this one was a fun and short stop, and we saw a cool turtle.

After that, we had Chicago's famous deep dish pizza at Lou Malnati's on Magnificent Mile. Super touristy, but the delicious crust is worth the wait. We also had some *really* good gelato -- green tea and amarena cherry at Cafe Cremerie.

Next stop: Museum of Contemporary Art. And the art was indeed, contemporary.

After that, we headed to the Chicago Architecture Center River Cruise, a very informative tour along the Chicago River. Our guide told us so much the buildings that form the skyline, and lots of very cool stories about the city's past (including the reversal of the Chicago river). There's no shortage of magnificent views either, and the whole experience really made me a lot more appreciative of architecture in general. Definitely one of the must-do things as a tourist in Chicago.

For dinner, we went to the popular Fulton Market area of Chicago where we had ramen. Finally, we went to The Aviary, a really fancy cocktail lounge with some very innovative drinks and delicious food.
