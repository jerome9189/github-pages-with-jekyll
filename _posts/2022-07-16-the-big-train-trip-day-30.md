It's the last day of our month-long trip! We started our day with a visit to the beautiful Lan Su Chinese garden where we saw lots of flora, before having some nice hot tea and a mooncake.

Later, we visited a few different donut shops, and we can reasonably conclude that Blue Star has the best donuts in Portland.

Finally, we grabbed some souvenirs for friends/family, had Thai for dinner, and got on the train home. This trip's been fun, but I've been dying to get home and cook my own food!
