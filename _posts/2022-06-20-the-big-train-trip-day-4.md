We woke up to a lot of rain today. The managers of the motel we were staying at were kind enough to give us a ride to the train station. I'd forgotten how tiny the East Glacier Park station was.

A horde of Amish people just showed up. I've never actually seen Amish people before, so this was a first. Oh, and they had a screaming baby, so that was fun. Onward.
